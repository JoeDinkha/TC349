	<h2>Get My Degree</h2>
	Raising my GPA and graduating with a great education is a huge priority for me over these next two years.  I can honestly say I've had a great time and huge learning experience at MSU, and am looking forward to learning more about CSE and TC these next few years.

	<h2>Travel</h2>
	Growing up and going to school while meeting people from different areas of the world, it's opened my mind up to traveling.  I used to be against this when I was younger but now I appreciate the experiences and possibilities, as well as the fun, that could come with another country!

	<h2>Keyboarding</h2>
	While my interest for fine arts has never been too high, it is another goal of mine to pick up keyboarding again.  This time I want to learn it to a full extent and be able to read sheet music perfectly.  I want to experiment with sound production.

	<span>
	<h2>Health & Lifestyle</h2>
	I want to start eating healthier too.  It's hard but I want to ensure I live as long as I can, this includes always staying active as well.	I want to help spread healthier practices to those around me as well.
