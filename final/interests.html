	<h2>Detroit Sports</h2>
	Growing up in metro Detroit I've always been a big sports fan of all the major teams.  Yup, all four of them. My favorite team to watch out of all of them would have to be the Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings are always doing great.  The Tigers are chasing the World Series championship, and the Pistons and Lions are rebuilding, not to mention they look promising.

	<h2> World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) </h2>
	One of the things I have always been a fan of, since I was 3 years old, was professional wrestling.  I love everything about that industry.  The athletes that take part in the storylines and matches have a quality unseen in other sports.  It's truly unique and pretty entertaining to watch.

	<h2>Nintendo</h2>
	This legendary company from Japan has provided me with some great childhood memories growing up. My favorite game from the company would have to be the Super Smash Bros. series, I find great replay value in playing it competitively.  No one can stop my Yoshi.
