	<h2> Welcome to Joe D's Homepage </h2>
	I decided to make my final project a showcase of all kinds of things.  This page is an overview of the types of content I have listed here.  I will be covering three things.  First I want to show off all the various interests I have that give me a recreational satisfaction.  You can also view all the sports I love to play and watch.  Finally, you'll be able to see my goals I have over the next few years.  Feel free to navigate the website as you please!

	<h2> What I Learned </h2>
	I am grateful to have learned more front-end web design from this class.  I am glad I can confidently do this by hand and only grow my skills from here with my further interest.  The concepts explained really broke down the class and made it simple to understand.  I will surely be taking Server-Side Web Development to learn back-end.
