	<h2>Soccer</h2>
	I enjoy playing and watching Soccer the most of any sport.  It is one that I feel can connect to more types of people than any sport.  It comes from all over the world.  I have been playing since my freshman year of high school and it has changed my life.  I worked hard on my skills to get better and it helped me to do the same with other things.

	<span2>
	<h2> Basketball </h2>
	Another sport I enjoy playing on a nice summer day.  Grab a few of your buddies and a game of 21 can become the activity for the entire day.  It gets competitive hitting shots in your friends faces or making them fall down with some quick foot action.
	</span2>
	
	<span2>
	<h2>Hockey</h2>
	Not only is this my favorite sport to watch but I enjoy playing floor or roller hockey whenever it is available.  This easily takes more short-spurt energy and is very rewarding when a nice play is made or a goal is scored.  Defintely a gym class favorite of mine.

	<span2>
	<h2>Strength Training</h2>
	Something I have adapted to my life for almost two years now is weight lifting.  This is a daily thing I do that helps me relieve stress and prove myself wrong.  If you ever want to test your thresholds or thoughts of what you're capable of, this is a great sport to pick up.
